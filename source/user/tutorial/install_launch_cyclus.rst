Installing and Launching Cyclus
===============================

For this tutorial, the |Cyclus|, and Cycamore programs are utilized. You can
install |Cyclus| using the following steps listed on the `Install Cyclus <http://fuelcycle.org/user/install.html>`_ page.
You can install Cycamore from the `Cycamore github repository <https://github.com/cyclus/cycamore>`_. 
You can install Cymetric from the `Cymetric github repository <https://github.com/cyclus/cymetric>`_. It is not required to 
install these programs becuase there is a cloud service available to running |Cyclus| input files, as discussed 
`here <https://fuelcycle.org/user/launch_cyclus.html>`.
